## Project Overview
The primary motivation behind Warehouse Connect is to provide a solution for the large-scale food and product wastage caused by inefficient supply chain and warehouse management systems. The platform allows warehouse owners to list available storage spaces and facilitates government agencies and business owners to reserve these spaces for their surplus goods, ensuring they are stored safely and efficiently.

By connecting available storage with demand, Warehouse Connect minimizes economic losses and contributes to a more sustainable food supply chain.

### Goals:
- **Reduce food and product wastage** by improving warehouse utilization.
- **Optimize food distribution** through better management of surplus storage.
- **Promote sustainability** by reducing resource waste and carbon footprint.

## Key Features
- **User Registration & Authentication**: Secure user accounts with the ability to list warehouses or find and reserve storage spaces.
- **Real-Time Warehouse Search**: Locate nearby warehouses with available storage capacity based on geolocation.
- **Inventory Management**: Track, update, and manage stored goods within the platform.
- **Booking & Reservations**: Easy booking process for reserving warehouse spaces.
- **Data Analytics**: Insights into storage utilization trends, warehouse performance, and inventory management.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: MySQL or PostgreSQL (depending on deployment)
- **Maps API**: Google Maps API for geolocation services
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 for secure user authentication
- **Hosting**: Deployed using AWS or any cloud provider
